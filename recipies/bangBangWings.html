    <h3>These bang bang wings are air fried, making them that much more awesome!</h3>
        
    <p>They're tossed in a perfectly balanced sauce with a sweet heat that lingers in a way that makes you want more. You could also grill, fry or roast them before tossing them in the sauce.</p>

    <h3>Ingridients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds chicken wings and drummettes</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt, divided</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon granulated garlic</li>
        <li>1/2 cup mayonnaise</li>
        <li>1/4 cup sweet chili sauce</li>
        <li>2 1/2 tablespoons Sriracha sauce</li>
        <li>1/4 cup sliced green onion</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Toss wings with olive oil, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Preheat the air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) according to manufacturer's directions.</li>
        <li>Add wings to the air fryer basket, and cook until golden brown and crispy, tossing every 8 to 10 minutes, 23 to 25 minutes total. You may have to work in batches.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, combine remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt with mayonnaise, sweet chili sauce, and Sriracha in a large bowl. Stir well to combine and set aside.</li>
        <li>Toss hot wings with sauce mixture until well coated.  Sprinkle with green onions and serve.</li>
    </ol>
